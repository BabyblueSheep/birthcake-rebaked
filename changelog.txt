- Code completely rewritten to be better compatible with mods, co-op, and overall way better optimized

Gameplay changes:
- Magdalene's Birthcake effect of granting soul hearts with Yum Heart use now scales with your trinket modifier instead of just Mom's Box, up to one and a half soul hearts
- Tainted Magdalene's Birthcake has hearts explode with a base damage value of 5.25 (2x T. Maggy's base damage, instead of half the player's damage) that increases based on the combined number of and total trinket multipliers of all Tainted Magdelenes with Birthcake
- Removed devil deal interaction with Judas/Dark Judas' Birthcake. Instead, if Judas would die, they will gain a black heart, damage all enemies in the room, and have Birthcake removed from their inventory. Any trinket multipliers will add an additional black heart
- Adjusted ??? Birthcake's poop spawning chances. Golden Poops can spawn with or without a trinket multiplier, but is much rarer at a 1% chance. Trinket multipliers as a whole contribute to the poop chance. Only one roll will be made and the rarest type will always be selected if the roll meets the chance requirements
- Removed Tainted Eve spawning clots twice as fast with Birthcake
- Lazarus will receive a soul heart upon reviving as Lazarus Risen instead of an extra heart container on a new floor
- Removed Lilith's secondary Birthcake effect of consuming the trinket on a new floor
- Chance of Lilith's familiars obtaining their tear effects from Birthcake increases with your trinket multiplier, +25% for each additional mulitplier
- Keeper's Birthcake spawns more nickels depending on your multiplier instead of spawning a Golden Penny when entering shops or devil rooms
- Fixed Apollyon's Birthcake smelting your current trinkets and un-smelting Birthcake if smelted
- Both normal and tainted Forgotten's Birthcakes spawn an orbital when killing an enemy, so long as they had the last hit from a player, instead of when damaging an enemy
- Both normal and tainted Forgotten's Birthcakes have a cap of 6 orbitals at a time
- Damage of Forgotten Birthcake's Purgatory Wisps and damage bonus given to The Soul scales based on trinket multiplier
- Tainted Forgotten's Birthcake spawns bone orbitals instead of fly orbitals, and only around The Soul
- Removed enemies targeting Tainted Forgotten with Birthcake
- Reworked Bethany's Birthcake. 25% of the time when using an active that would spawn a wisp will spawn another wisp of the same type. Chance scales with trinket multipliers
- Reworked Tainted Bethany's Birthcake
- J&E's Birthcake now only takes 10% of the other brother's stats instead of 25% (I mean seriously that's more than Cracked Crown, and that's not including base stats)
- Reworked Tainted Jacob's Birthcake. Dark Esau will eat the cupcake and grow in strength instead of befriending Tainted Jacob. Their collision damage will be boosted, but their hitbox size will also slightly increase

Modding API:
- Has both BirthcakeRebaked and Birthcake globals, the latter for backwards compatibility
- Nearly everything in the mod is exposed under the BirthcakeRebaked global, following Epiphany codebase style of formatting
