With the mod released, although this is a separate entity from the original mod, here's a list of every change that was made:

General additions/changes:
- Code completely rewritten to be better compatible with mods, co-op, and overall way better optimized
- Improved EID support
- Multilingual descriptions! Both EID and the Birthcake names and descriptions support the following languages: English, Russian, Spanish, Czech, Polish, Korean, Brazilian Portuguese
- In co-op play, Birthcake will take on its default appearance, and will have its sprite updated when picked up by the player
- The unique Birthcake sprite for each character now appears on the HUD, powered by HudHelper
- A completely different sprite base for the tainted characters, as well as some touchups to vanilla ones, courtesy of the original spriter, damagaz
- Mod Config Menu support. Has pickup-text-related settings for language and changing the name of tainted characters

Isaac's Birthday Party Challenge:
- Now randomly selects characters to play as when decending floors as opposed to a set order. This is still restricted to vanilla characters
- Now displays a "defeat goal" icon for The Beast on the HUD and actually makes The Beast reachable, as the Ascent door never spawns which the OG challenge did not account for
- You now start with Dice Shard instead of D6 (to match the effect of Isaac's Birthcake)
- Sacrifice and Error Rooms are no longer filtered out
- Trinkets cannot spawn, being replaced with a random heart, coin, bomb, or key pickup instead. Birthcake itself does not apply to this
- Changed Difficulty from Hard to Normal
- Changed what characters get free items spawned for them when entering a new floor to match what's required for that character's effect to be properly triggered
- These free items are now removed when moving to the next floor
- Made some improvements to maintaining your health when swapping to and from The Lost or The Keeper

Birthcake effect changes:
- Magdalene's "doubling" effect now affects Scared Hearts and Half Soul Hearts, reduced from 50% chance to 25%
- Removed Magdalene's Half Soul Heart heal with Yum Heart
- Tainted Magdalene has hearts explode with a base damage value that scales with the current stage and total trinket multipliers of all Tainted Magdelenes with Birthcake rather than scaling with player damage
- Tainted Magdalene's heart explosions no longer act as literal bomb explosions, and as such will not break grid entities, but will still damage enemies and pierce armor
- Removed Tainted Cain's effect of a 5% chance to give you a pickup you bagged
- Judas'/Dark Judas' damage up has been reduced from +20% to +15%
- Devil Deals will consume Birthcake if the deal would otherwise be fatal instead of giving them for free all the time
- Tainted ???'s poops have a chance to not take any damage instead of being immune. Previously it just deleted projectiles, but now blocks damage from any sources, including your own
- Removed Tainted ???'s poops having collision removed and causing slowness
- Removed Tainted Eve spawning clots twice as fast
- Tainted Eve's clots leave different types of creep depending on the clot that died
- Samson's interaction with trinket multipliers are better at detecting what kind of heart it should spawn depending on your current health
- Tainted Samson will have an equal chance of spawning any variant of heart pickup, instead always spawning a half red heart
- Removed Lilith's secondary effect of consuming the trinket on a new floor and gaining a familiar
- Chance of Lilith's familiars obtaining their tear effects increases with your trinket multiplier, +25% for each additional mulitplier
- Keeper spawns more nickels depending on your multiplier instead of spawning a Golden Penny when entering shops or devil rooms
- Apollyon will have a chance of absorbing a duplicate of a trinket with any number of trinket multipliers

Birthcake effect reworks:
- Isaac spawns a Dice Shard every floor and on Birthcake first pickup. Spawned amount scales with trinket multipliers
- Tainted Isaac gains an extra inventory slot that's tied to the Birthcake. Your number of extra inventory slots scales with your trinket multiplier
- Tainted Judas will gain active charge to Dark Arts when passing through enemies instead of slowing them
- ??? has different interactions between The Poop and other actives. With The Poop, it spawns 2 additional poops directly adjacent to the initial poop depending on the direction you're facing, creating a wall. With other actives, it shoots out mini poops in random directions based on the number of charges the active has, which has similar conditions to The Poop of being different variants
- Eve's Dead Bird turns into Blood Bird, scaling off of player damage (cannot go below their base damage, and scales respectfully to not be too crazy) and occasionally leaves small damaging puddles of blood
- Azazel has the duration of their beam extended so long as it damages enemies, for a maximum time of 3x the typical duration. Trinket multipliers will each add +50% of this duration. Also comes with a -10% damage reduction
- Tainted Azazel shoots 6 booger tears in front of them upon sneezing that all inflict the Brimstone Curse on contact. 10% chance for them to stick to enemies. Has an interaction with Birthright
- Eden's Birthcake grants 3 random gulped trinkets, additional trinkets based on multipliers. The trinkets are tied to Birthcake, meaning dropping it will remove the trinkets, picking it up will re-grant them
- Tainted Eden has a chance to not reroll their items on hit, scaling with trinket multipliers
- Lazarus gains an extra Lazarus' Rags revive that has priority over most extra life counters, not counting his own innate revive and the item itself. Upon revive, the cake is consumed, and you'll gain another point to the damage boost you gain as you normally would with a Laz's Rags revive. More damage is added if it was a golden trinket and/or if you have Mom's Box
- Tainted Lazarus will have a chance to split flipped collectible apart in two
- The Lost has an Astral Projection-like effect upon losing all of their Holy Mantle charges, slowing everything in the room down briefly. Trinket multipliers will freeze enemies in a radius for 5 seconds
- Tainted Lilith has a chance to shoot out a second, smaller Gello that deals 50% damage. It does not shoot out of Lilith like a whip, unlike the main Gello
- When The Soul shoots through Forgotten's Body, it creates a Compound Fracture effect of 1-3 half-damage bone tears, trinket multipliers adding more bones. Doing this charges The Forgotten's body with "soul charge". When swapping back to The Forgotten, the stored charges convert to a fading firerate up. This stat increase instantly goes away when swapping back to The Soul
- Tainted Forgotten will spawn bone orbitals when killing enemies, which will orbit around Tainted Soul. When picking up T. Forgotten and throwing them, the bone orbitals are shot forward like tears
- Bethany will spawn a duplicate wisp of the same type 25% of the time when using an active item. Chance scales with trinket multipliers
- Tainted Bethany's wisps now have double health when being spawned. This does not affect the Birthright-spawned wisps. They spawn with an additional +2 HP with trinket multipliers
- Jacob & Esau, whichever brother has Birthcake, will reflect their received damage onto the other brother
- Tainted Jacob will have Dark Esau spawn a trail of flames that block projectiles and tears as well as damage both you and enemies

Modding API:
- Has both BirthcakeRebaked and Birthcake globals, the latter for backwards compatibility
- Nearly everything in the mod is exposed under the BirthcakeRebaked global, following Epiphany's codebase style
- Various callbacks and API functions have been added for easier modding support
